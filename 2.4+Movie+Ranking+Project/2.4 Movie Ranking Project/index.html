<h1>The 3 best movies according to Steve</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Terminator 2</h3>
<p>This movie is a classic. Movie about a liquid metal man from the future that tries to kill 
    main character John Conner so that he doesn't grow up to become the leader that takes out the machines as they try to kill all
    mankind. Arnold Schwarzenneger is also a machine that John sent from the future to go back and help protect him against
    the T1000 liquid metal man.

<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>Horror movie with Sigorny Weaver. Lots of blood and gore. Sigorny (Ridley) and her team of scientists set
    out to scout the universe for life, and they do indeed find life but not the type that they wanted to!
</p>
<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>American classic. Young Tom Cruise is a fighter pilot eager to take on the enemy forces from around 
    the world. He meets a woman and falls in love with her! lots of action and romance!
